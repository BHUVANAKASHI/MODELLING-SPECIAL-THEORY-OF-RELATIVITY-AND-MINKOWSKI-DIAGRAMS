# Special theory of relativity in breif:
The theory of special relativity explains how space and time are linked for objects that are moving at a consistent speed in a straight line. One of its most famous aspects concerns objects moving at the speed of light. 
Simply put, as an object approaches the speed of light, its mass becomes infinite and it is unable to go any faster than light travels. This cosmic speed limit
has been a subject of much discussion in physics, and even in science fiction,as people think about how to travel across vast distances.
The theory of special relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905, and it forms part of the basis of modern physics. After finishing his work in special relativity, Einstein spent a decade pondering what would happen if one introduced acceleration. This formed the basis of his general relativity, published in 1915.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The theory of special relativity explains how space and time are linked for objects that are moving at a consistent speed in a straight line.
There is alot of data and linear mathematics and ambiguity involved in understanding the observers and the objects motion relative to each other. Caluculating the points and plotting the Minkowski diagrams manually is exasperating.This project provides a rapid and smart way to caluculate and obtain various terms and graphs involved in understanding the relative motions wrt the observer and the object.The project is 100% python and involves libraries such as matplotlib , math, numpy and random

# INPUTS FROM THE USER REQUIRED:
The user needs to input the following:
1. users space time coordinates
2. observed pbjects space time coordinates
3. velocity of the object with respect to the user
4. The length of the object (if the object has any)
5. users name
#
# OUTPUTS OBTAINED:
1. Lorentz factor
2. Length Contraction
3. Time lag between the front and rear end of the object
4. Time dialation
5. Lorentz transformed space time coordintaes of the object with respect to the user
6. Lorentz transformed space time coordinates of the user with respect to the object
7. A graph locating the user and the object plotted according to the inputs provided.
8. Minowski Diagram with respect to the user.
9. Minowski Diagram with respect to the object.
